We are softly releasing FlatCityBuf, see [its webpage]({{ site.baseurl }}/flatcitybuf/). 
It's still in beta, but it is usable and shows its potential.

[Hidemichi Baba](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hideba) will be presenting FlatCityBuf at the next [3DGeoInfo conference in Tokyo](https://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/3d_geoinfo_sdsc_2025/overview.html) also! We hope to see you there!
