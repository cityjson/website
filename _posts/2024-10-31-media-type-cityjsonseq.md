CityJSONSeq now has [its own media type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/city+json-seq), which is also known as a MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).

A media type indicates the content and format of a document, and is widely used on the web.

CityJSONSeq has the following type: `application/city+json-seq`.

CityJSON files also have their own media type: [`application/city+json`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/city+json).
